  abstract: Accurate timing of movement in the hundreds of milliseconds range is a
    hallmark of human activities such as music and dance. Its study requires accurate
    measurement of the times of events (often called responses) based on the movement
    or acoustic record. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of methods
    developed to capture, process, analyse, and model individual and group timing.In
    a classic paper on sensorimotor timing, Stevens (1886) used a combination of paced
    and unpaced tapping over a range of tempos to describe what we would now recognise
    as characteristic attributes of movement timing. Participants tapped with a metronome

  title: Estimating the loudness balance of musical mixtures using audio source separation
  container-title: 3rd workshop on intelligent music production
  publisher-place: Salford, UK
  abstract: To assist with the development of intelligent mixing systems, it would
    be useful to be able to extract the loudness balance of sources in an existing
    musical mixture. The relative-to-mix loudness level of four instrument groups
    was predicted using the sources extracted by 12 audio source separation algorithms.
    The predictions were compared with the ground truth loudness data of the original
    unmixed stems obtained from a recent dataset involving 100 mixed songs. It was
    found that the best source separation system could predict the relative loudness
    of each instrument group with an average root-mean-square error of 1.2 LU, with
    superior performance obtained on vocals.

  title: Perceptual evaluation of source separation for remixing music

  publisher-place: New York, NY
  page: Paper 9880
  abstract: Music remixing is difficult when the original multitrack recording is
    not available. One solution is to estimate the elements of a mixture using source
    separation. However, existing techniques suffer from imperfect separation and
    perceptible artifacts on single separated sources. To investigate their influence
    on a remix, five state-of-the-art source separation algorithms were used to remix
    six songs by increasing the level of the vocals. A listening test was conducted
    to assess the remixes in terms of loudness balance and sound quality. The results
    show that some source separation algorithms are able to increase the level of
    the vocals by up to 6 dB at the cost of introducing a small but perceptible degradation
    in sound quality.

    for Monaural Audio Source Separation</span>
  container-title: ArXiv e-prints
  abstract: In deep neural networks with convolutional layers, each layer typically
    has fixed-size/single-resolution receptive field (RF). Convolutional layers with
    a large RF capture global information from the input features, while layers with
    small RF size capture local details with high resolution from the input features.
    In this work, we introduce novel deep multi-resolution fully convolutional neural
    networks (MR-FCNN), where each layer has different RF sizes to extract multi-resolution
    features that capture the global and local details information from its input
    features. The proposed MR-FCNN is applied to separate a target audio source from
    a mixture of many audio sources. Experimental results show that using MR-FCNN
    improves the performance compared to feedforward deep neural networks (DNNs) and
    single resolution deep fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) on the audio
    source separation problem.

  container-title: 2018 IEEE international conference on acoustics, speech and signal

  publisher: IEEE
  publisher-place: Calgary, Canada
  abstract: There is some uncertainty as to whether objective metrics for predicting
    the perceived quality of audio source separation are sufficiently accurate. This
    issue was investigated by employing a revised experimental methodology to collect
    subjective ratings of sound quality and interference of singing-voice recordings
    that have been extracted from musical mixtures using state-of-the-art audio source
    separation. A correlation analysis between the experimental data and the measures
    of two objective evaluation toolkits, BSS Eval and PEASS, was performed to assess
    their performance. The artifacts-related perceptual score of the PEASS toolkit
    had the strongest correlation with the perception of artifacts and distortions
    caused by singing-voice separation. Both the source-to-interference ratio of BSS
    Eval and the interference-related perceptual score of PEASS showed comparable
    correlations with the human ratings of interference.

  publisher-place: Huddersfield, United Kingdom
  abstract: The Signal Separation Evaluation Campaign (SiSEC) is a large-scale regular
    event aimed at evaluating current progress in source separation through a systematic
    and reproducible comparison of the participants’ algorithms, providing the source
    separation community with an invaluable glimpse of recent achievements and open
    challenges. This paper focuses on the music separation task from SiSEC 2018, which
    compares algorithms aimed at recovering instrument stems from a stereo mix. In
    this context, we conducted a subjective evaluation whereby 34 listeners picked
    which of six competing algorithms, with high objective performance scores, best
    separated the singing-voice stem from 13 professionally mixed songs. The subjective
    results reveal strong differences between the algorithms, and highlight the presence
    of song-dependent performance for state-of-the-art systems. Correlations between
    the subjective results and the scores of two popular performance metrics are also
    presented.

    Convolutional layers with neurons that have large RF capture global information

    novel deep multi-resolution fully convolutional neural networks (MR-FCN), where

  abstract: Supervised multi-channel audio source separation requires extracting useful
    spectral, temporal, and spatial features from the mixed signals. the success of
    many existing systems is therefore largely dependent on the choice of features
    used for training. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-channel, multiresolution
    convolutional auto-encoder neural network that works on raw time-domain signals
    to determine appropriate multiresolution features for separating the singing-voice
    from stereo music. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can
    achieve multi-channel audio source separation without the need for hand-crafted
    features or any pre- or post-processing.

  title: Referenceless performance evaluation of audio source separation using deep
    neural networks
  container-title: 27th european signal processing conference (eusipco)
  publisher: IEEE
  publisher-place: A Coruña, Spain
  abstract: Current performance evaluation for audio source separation depends on
    comparing the processed or separated signals with reference signals. Therefore,
    common performance evaluation toolkits are not applicable to real-world situations
    where the ground truth audio is unavailable. In this paper, we propose a performance
    evaluation technique that does not require reference signals in order to assess
    separation quality. The proposed technique uses a deep neural network (DNN) to
    map the processed audio into its quality score. Our experiment results show that
    the DNN is capable of predicting the sources-to-artifacts ratio from the blind
    source separation evaluation toolkit \[1\] for singing-voice separation without
    the need for reference signals.
