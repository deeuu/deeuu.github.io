  brief:
    C++ Audio library for modelling perceived loudness, with Python bindings
    (via Swig). Developed during my PhD at Birmingham City University, and has
    been used by myself and others to develop interesting real-time audio
    applications centred on loudness and masking estimation. The library is
    particularly suited to computing auditory features that depend on multiple
    sources.
