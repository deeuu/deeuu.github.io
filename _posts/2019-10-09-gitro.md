A few months a go I gave a talk introducing [git](https://git-scm.com/) to the
[Scientific
Computing](https://medphys.royalsurrey.nhs.uk/department/scientific-computing/)
group (where I work) at The Royal Surrey County Hospital.  The talk covers the
concept of version control, basic workflows, repository syncing, and
branching.

You can view the talk at
[scicomcore.bitbucket.io/gitro](https://scicomcore.bitbucket.io/gitro/#1), and
find the [source code](https://gitlab.com/deeuu/gitro) on my [personal
Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/deeuu).  I used
[dotlive](https://github.com/sloria/doitlive) to get the basics across and
simulate typical collaborative workflows (it's a little random, but I like to
keep things spicy). You can check out the shell scripts on the
[`demo_code`](https://gitlab.com/deeuu/gitro/tree/demo_code/demo) branch of the
repo.

Since then our group have been discussing practical aspects of git, such as how
to handle configuration files when deploying a project, so it would be nice to
run a second session touching on these, in addition to diving a little deeper!
