Hey, I'm Dom and welcome to my site!

I'm currently working in [Scientific
Computing](https://medphys.royalsurrey.nhs.uk/department/scientific-computing/)
within The Medical Physics Department at The Royal Surrey County Hospital,
Guildford, UK.

I studied sound engineering and production and Birmingham City University in
2010, after which I stayed on to complete my PhD in Audio Engineering in 2017.
I have worked as a research fellow at The Sensory Motor Neuroscience Centre,
University of Birmingham, where I conducted psychophysical experiments to study
inter-player timing synchronisation of musical ensembles. In 2017 I moved to
Guildford to work as a Post-Doc on the EPSRC-funded project [Musical Audio
Repurposing using Source Separation](https://cvssp.github.io/maruss-website/)
(MARuSS) at The Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP);
University of Surrey.

I'm interesting in audio engineering, psychophysics, software development, all
things code, food, beer, travelling and I also really like dogs. Checkout my
publications and software projects for specifics.
